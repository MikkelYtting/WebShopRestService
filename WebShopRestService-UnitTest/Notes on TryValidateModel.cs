/*  
    When you use Validator.TryValidateObject in your TryValidateModel method, it applies all the validation rules defined by the data annotations in your model class to the instance of that class.
    This means that it checks every property in the object that has validation attributes associated with it.
    For your Category class, this includes:
   
   Name: Validated for being required, having a specific string length, and matching a regular expression pattern.
   
   Description: Although it only has a maximum length constraint, it will be checked if the length exceeds the defined limit.
   
   Products: If there are any custom validation attributes (like EnsureNonEmptyCollectionAttribute), these will also be evaluated.
   
    During the validation process, Validator. TryValidateObject will go through each property and check if it meets the criteria specified by its annotations. 
    If any property fails its validation (for example, if Name is too short, too long, or doesn't match the required pattern), 
    the method will return false, and the validation errors will be added to the results collection.
   
    This comprehensive validation is useful for ensuring that an entire object is valid according to your model's rules. 
    However, when testing specific properties or behaviors, this can lead to complications, as validation failures in unrelated parts of the model can affect the outcome. 
    That's why isolating validation to a specific property can be beneficial in certain testing scenarios, as it allows you to focus solely on the behavior of that particular property.*/
